# Vibe Dialog System Design Document

## Overview

Vibe Dialog is a text-based dialogue system designed for legal professionals to interact with documents, search for information, and maintain conversation history with proper citations and annotations. The system emphasizes a robust backend model with strong support for document management, semantic search, citations, and annotations.

## Design Principles

1. **Command Pattern for State Management**
   - All actions that modify state are encapsulated as commands
   - Provides built-in undo/redo functionality
   - Makes the application more maintainable and testable
   - Ensures atomicity of operations

2. **Layered Architecture**
   - Models Layer: Core data structures using Python dataclasses
   - Services Layer: Business logic for document management, search, and dialogue
   - Commands Layer: Implementations of the Command pattern for operations
   - API Layer: RESTful endpoints exposing functionality
   - Presentation Layer: UI components for interaction

3. **Rich Document Model**
   - Documents as first-class citizens with full metadata
   - Support for annotations, citations, and tagging
   - File attachments with proper handling
   - Version tracking and history

4. **Semantic Search Capabilities**
   - Multiple search providers (local, semantic, hybrid)
   - Contextual results with relevance scoring
   - Result highlighting and context extraction
   - Filterable search with tags and metadata

5. **User-Centric Design**
   - Persistent user profiles with preferences
   - Document history tracking
   - UI customization options
   - Context-aware interactions

## Core Components

### Models

The models form the foundation of the system and represent the domain entities:

1. **DialogueContext**: Represents a conversation session with:
   - Messages: The conversation history
   - Documents: Documents relevant to the conversation
   - User Profile: Information about the user
   - Search Results: Current search state
   - Active document: Currently viewed document

2. **Document**: Represents a document with:
   - Content: The document text
   - Metadata: Additional information
   - Annotations: User-added notes, highlights, etc.
   - Citations: References to sources
   - File: Optional attached file
   - Tags: User-defined categorization

3. **Annotation**: Represents a note or highlight applied to a document:
   - Type: Comment, highlight, citation, etc.
   - Text: The annotation content
   - Position: Where the annotation is attached in the document
   - Citations: References supporting the annotation

4. **Citation**: Represents a reference to a source:
   - Text: The cited text
   - Source: Where the citation comes from
   - Page/Section: Location within the source
   - URL: Optional link to online source

### Services

Services encapsulate business logic and provide operations on the models:

1. **DialogueService**: Manages conversation state:
   - Create/close dialogue contexts
   - Add messages from users, system, or assistant
   - Track active documents and search results

2. **DocumentService**: Handles document operations:
   - Create, update, and delete documents
   - Manage annotations and citations
   - Handle file uploads and downloads
   - Tag management

3. **SearchService**: Provides search functionality:
   - Multiple search providers (local, semantic, hybrid)
   - Filtering and ranking of results
   - Context extraction around matches
   - Result management

### Commands

Commands implement the Command pattern to encapsulate operations:

1. **Document Commands**:
   - CreateDocumentCommand: Creates a new document
   - UpdateDocumentCommand: Modifies an existing document
   - AddAnnotationCommand: Adds an annotation to a document
   - AddCitationCommand: Adds a citation to a document or annotation
   - AddTagCommand: Adds a tag to a document

2. **Search Commands**:
   - SearchDocumentsCommand: Searches documents and stores results

3. **CommandHistory**: Manages executed commands for undo/redo.

## User Interface Components

While the UI implementation can vary, the system is designed to support these key UI components:

1. **Conversation Panel**:
   - Message display with user/system/assistant differentiation
   - Message composition with support for references
   - Citation integration within messages

2. **Document Explorer**:
   - Document listing with filtering and sorting
   - Document creation and upload
   - Tags and metadata display

3. **Document Viewer**:
   - Content display with annotations
   - Annotation creation interface
   - Citation management
   - File attachment handling

4. **Search Interface**:
   - Query input with search provider selection
   - Filters for refining search
   - Result display with context and highlighting
   - Integration with document viewer

5. **User Profile**:
   - Preference management
   - Document history
   - Settings configuration

## Interactions and Workflow

### Document Management Workflow

1. User creates or uploads a document
2. System processes document and makes it available for search
3. User can add annotations, citations, and tags
4. User can reference document in conversations
5. All changes are tracked for undo/redo

### Search Workflow

1. User enters a search query
2. User selects search provider and filters
3. System performs search and returns ranked results
4. Results show context and highlighting
5. User can click to view full document
6. Document opens with search term highlighted

### Conversation Workflow

1. User sends a message
2. System processes message and generates response
3. Response may include citations from documents
4. User can view cited documents
5. Conversation history is maintained

## Technical Implementation

### Data Storage

For simplicity, the current implementation uses in-memory storage, but the design supports:

1. **Document Storage**:
   - File system for document files
   - Vector database for semantic search
   - Relational or document database for metadata

2. **Conversation Storage**:
   - Persistent storage for conversation history
   - User profile and preferences

### Search Implementation

The search implementation provides:

1. **Local Search**: Basic keyword matching with context extraction
2. **Semantic Search**: Vector-based search (simulated in current implementation)
3. **Hybrid Search**: Combination of keyword and semantic approaches

### Command Pattern Implementation

The Command pattern implementation provides:

1. **Atomicity**: Commands succeed or fail as a unit
2. **Reversibility**: All commands can be undone
3. **History**: Command history for undo/redo
4. **Extensibility**: New commands can be added without modifying existing code

## Extensibility and Future Enhancements

The system is designed for easy extension in several areas:

1. **Additional Search Providers**:
   - Integration with external search APIs
   - Advanced ranking algorithms
   - Domain-specific search capabilities

2. **Enhanced Document Processing**:
   - OCR for scanned documents
   - Document summarization
   - Automatic tagging and categorization

3. **Advanced UI Features**:
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Document comparison
   - Advanced visualization of search results

4. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - API for external system integration
   - Import/export functionality
   - Authentication and authorization

## Conclusion

The Vibe Dialog system provides a robust foundation for legal document management and conversation with strong support for annotations, citations, and semantic search. The Command pattern ensures reliable state management, while the layered architecture supports maintainability and extensibility.

The system balances simplicity with power, offering a straightforward interface for common tasks while supporting advanced features for sophisticated users. The design principles prioritize data integrity, user experience, and system robustness.
